# Talia's Portfolio Page ðŸŒ¸

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This is a simple and elegant webpage built using HTML and images to represent who I am. It includes my profile photo, links to my social media accounts, and icons of the programming languages and technologies Iâ€™m familiar with.

The design is clean and minimal, making it easy to navigate and view. Youâ€™ll find icons that represent my skills in HTML, JavaScript, and C++, along with direct links to my social profiles like GitHub, Facebook, and Instagram.

## Features

- Profile picture and introduction
- Social media icons with links
- Programming languages and tools represented visually
- Simple and neat layout

## Folder Structure

The project contains the main HTML file (`index.html`), a profile image, and a folder with icons representing technologies and platforms:

```
talia-protofile-main/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html               # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ profileimage.jpg         # Profile picture
